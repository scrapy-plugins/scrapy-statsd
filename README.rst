scrapy-statsd-extension
=======================

The scrapy-statsd-extension is a scrapy extension to send scrapy stats
to statsd host.

Naming
------

Scrapy stats names will be mapped to names supported by statsd. Some
examples:

::

    finish_reason -> finish_reason
    downloader/request_bytes -> downloader.request_bytes
    downloader/request_method_count/GET -> downloader.request_method_count.GET
    robotstxt/exception_count/<class 'PermissionError'> -> robotstxt.exception_count.class_PermissionError

Installation
------------

Install scrapy-statsd-extension using ``pip``:

::

    $ pip install scrapy-statsd-extension

Configuration
-------------

First, you need to include the extension to your ``EXTENSIONS`` dict in
``settings.py``, like so:

::

    STATSD_ENABLED = True

    EXTENSIONS = {
        ...
        'scrapy_statsd_extension.StatsdExtension': 123,
        ...
    }

Settings
--------

To configure host settings, you can adjust the following:

::

    STATSD_HOST = 'localhost'
    STATSD_PORT = 8125

The default endpoint for sending stats will be:

::

    http://localhost:8125

To enable the extension you must set:

::

    STATSD_ENABLED = False

Periodic logging is enabled by default but you can disable it, in which
case the metrics will be logged only once, when a spider is closed:

::

    STATSD_LOG_PERIODIC = True

By default, stats are logged every 5 seconds, you can adjust that using
``STATSD_LOG_EVERY`` which is the number of seconds between logging
operations:

::

    STATSD_LOG_EVERY = 5

Set the desired prefix:

::

    STATSD_PREFIX = 'scrapy'

You can specify which prefixes you want logged if you don't want all
scrapy stats. The default is an empty list which indicates that all
stats should be logged. You can, for example, log only downloader and
robotstxt exception stats by setting ``STATSD_LOG_ONLY`` to
``['downloader', 'robotstxt.exception_count']``.

::

    STATSD_LOG_ONLY = []

You can also specify prefixes to ignore the same way using
``STATSD_IGNORE``:

::

    STATSD_IGNORE = []

Handlers
--------

This extension currently supports sending stats to 3 collectors: graphite, 
telegraf and datadog.

To enable each of these you have to set ``STATSD_HANDLER``:

Please note that tags for graphite handler are not currently supported. To set
the handler:

::

    STATSD_HANDLER = "scrapy_statsd_extension.handlers.graphite.GraphiteHandler"

For telegraf, you will need the statsd input plugin.

::

    STATSD_HANDLER = "scrapy_statsd_extension.handlers.telegraf.TelegrafHandler"

For datadog, you will need to set your api key in ``DATADOG_API_KEY`` in
settings or as a system variable.

::

    STATSD_HANDLER = "scrapy_statsd_extension.handlers.datadog.DatadogHandler"


Tags
----

Certain platforms such as datadog and influxdb offer tagging options.


To enable tagging set ``STATSD_TAGGING`` to ``True``, it is disabled by
default:

::

    STATSD_TAGGING = False

Then, you can set custom tags using ``STATSD_TAGS``. Currently, only
``spider_name_tag`` is supported and setting it to True will add the spider's
as a tag on all metrics:

::

    STATSD_TAGS = {
        'spider_name_tag': True
    }

You can also set custom tags by setting ``statsd_tags`` attribute on each 
spider. This must be a dictionary containing tag names as keys and tag values as
dictionary values.
